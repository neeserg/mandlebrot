# mandlebrot

## The Initial Pyton file
- Have not added iterative solution. Just did a 100 to find the magnitude that is smaller than 1. I do use a colormap but currently mapping the magnitude
  after 100 iterations
- Next step is to make image that maps the iteration to the color.

## Make C++ or Rust implementation (TODO)
- speed up the image generation
- make it interactive
- use GPU.
